# Introduction

[WaterNSW](https://www.waternsw.com.au/) monitors the quality and levels of rivers, dams and groundwater across the state of New South Wales, Australia. WaterNSW provides access to this data [via their website](https://realtimedata.waternsw.com.au/), [mobile apps](https://www.waternsw.com.au/supply/regional-nsw/real-time-data#footer) as well as a web service.

The web service allows a user to request realtime and historical timeseries data for monitoring site via its HTTP interface and have the data returned in JSON or CSV format. This 'unofficial' guide aims to make this data more accessible.

>**Please note:** This documentation is not exhaustive. The intention is to cover common use cases and recommend approaches to shorten the learning curve.

## Dive in

The two main parts of the documentation are:

  - [Getting started](/getting-started.md):  Making requests to the API and what can be expected in response.
  - [API reference](/api-reference.md): The API reference contains information on the possible API calls and examples of their use.

**Both sections are works in progress.**
