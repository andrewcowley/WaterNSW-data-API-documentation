# Introduction

[WaterNSW](https://www.waternsw.com.au/) monitors the quality and levels of rivers, dams and groundwater across the state of New South Wales, Australia. WaterNSW provides access to this data [via their website](https://realtimedata.waternsw.com.au/), [mobile apps](https://www.waternsw.com.au/supply/regional-nsw/real-time-data#footer) as well as a web service.

The web service allows a user to request realtime and historical data for monitoring site via its HTTP interface and have the data returned in JSON or CSV format.

The data provided by the web service is excellent, but the documentation provided on using the web service is lacking. This 'unofficial' documentation aims to make the data more accessible to developers by providing a Developer guide, and API reference.
